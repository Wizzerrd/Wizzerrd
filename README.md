### Hi! My name is Luis Laffitte, also known as Wizzerrd. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíΩ Welcome to my Github!

I have a passion for building and understanding how I can build the best things possible. One of my favorite things is developing a new approach to a problem I am faced with, though I am never opposed to learning strategy from those who know more than me. I'm a full stack developer with tools like React, Rails and Express, and I'm always delving into how my tools work and what new tools I can add to my kit. I am also an indie game developer, making games using Godot Engine with GDScript.
